          <h1>The Origin of Chess: A Journey Through Time</h1>
          <section class="description">  
            <p>
              Chess, known as "the game of kings," has a rich history dating back thousands of years. Although its exact origin is still debated, it is believed that chess originated in India around the 6th century with the game called "chaturanga," which was played on an 8x8 board and reflected the different branches of the military: infantry, cavalry, elephants, and chariots.

                After its spread to the Arab world, chess was introduced to Europe in the Middle Ages, where it evolved into the game we know today. During the 15th and 16th centuries, the rules of chess were standardized, and the first international competitions began to be held.
